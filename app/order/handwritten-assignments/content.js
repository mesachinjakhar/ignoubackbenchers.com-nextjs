        🧠 IS THE TERM-END EXAMINATION AND IGNOU HANDWRITTEN ASSIGNMENTS
        RELATED❓
      </h3>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        💡 The IGNOU assignment is mandatory for appearing for the term-end
        examination of the selected subject. If the assignment is not submitted,
        the candidate will not be permitted to appear for the term-end
        examinations. However, the candidate can also present their IGNOU
        handwritten solved assignment irrespective of the exam. Since exams are
        mandatory and the handwritten assignments are valid for a term of 4
        semesters, the students need to continue clearing their term-end
        examination to proceed further with their studies.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-black mb-3 mt-5">
        🧠 IS IT COMPULSORY TO SUBMIT IGNOU HANDWRITTEN ASSIGNMENTS❓
      </h3>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        💡 Yes! Assignments are an important part of the curriculum as they
        carry a weightage of 30% during evaluation. As a student needs a total
        of 40% to successfully clear their exam, assignments carry a significant
        weightage in academics.
